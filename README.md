# GUI-for-py-avataaars
This application provides you a graphical user interface for py-avataaars which is a great tool for creating avatars using python script. I wanted to create the simplest yet powerful GUI using Python Tkinter.

<h3>I also plan to make an executable for people without python installed</h3>

<h1>Using python-script version</h1>

<ul>
<li>You must have a working python3 installation and install py-avataaars using pip (see the py-avataaars repository for further instructions)</li>
<li>You will need to install the GTK3 libraries - the installer for the MS Windows version can be found in the root folder</li>
<li>Download the "GUI-FOR-PY-AVATAAARS 1.0.0" folder and move it where you want (it can be your own project folder)</li>
<li>You can run the GFPA.py script directly from the python terminal and the GUI will appear</li>
<li>In addition, you can import it into your own project or modify it to your liking :-)</li>
</ul>

I know it's really simple, but that was part of the idea. It is versatile and flexible for different applications.
